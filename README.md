### Instructions

1. Ensure all required libraries are installed.
   - If any library is missing, install it using the command:
     ```bash
     !pip install <library_name>
     ```

2. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks from top to bottom.
   - Note: Training some models may take up to an hour.

3. Use the `ReadModel` function from the `PythonFiles` folder to load pre-trained models.

### Notes
- The project folders are structured as follows:
  - **PythonFiles:** Contains scripts for training and analysis.
  - **TrainedModels:** Includes already trained model files for quick use.
  - **data:** Stores datasets used during project development.
